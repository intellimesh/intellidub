A Journey of Liberty, Equality, and Justice, American Democracy in Progress American democracy began with ideals of liberty and equality envisioned by the founding fathers. In 1776, the Declaration of Independence proclaimed freedom from British rule. The U.S. Constitution, established in 1787, laid the foundation for American governance. The first ten amendments guaranteed essential rights like free speech and religious freedom. Three branches. Executive, legislative, and judicial ensured a balanced government. Power was divided between federal and state governments to maintain local autonomy. Democracy grew as voting rights expanded from landowners to all citizens over time. The Civil War preserved the Union and led to the abolition of slavery in 1865. The 19th Amendment, ratified in 1920, granted women the right to vote. In the 1930s, FDR's New Deal addressed economic turmoil and expanded government roles. The 1950s and 60s saw struggles for racial equality, led by figures like Martin Luther King Jr. The 1960s and 70s anti-war protests highlighted citizens'power to demand change. The 1970s Watergate scandal emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability. Voting protections like the Voting Rights Act continued to ensure equal access to the ballot. The Internet age reshaped political communication and public participation. Rising polarization in recent years tested the resilience of democratic ideals. Movements today reflect ongoing struggles for social and economic justice. American democracy remains a work in progress, shaped by each generation's pursuit of freedom.
